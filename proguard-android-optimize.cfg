# This is a configuration file for ProGuard.
# http://proguard.sourceforge.net/index.html#manual/usage.html

#Warning: can't find referenced class
#If there are unresolved references to classes or interfaces, you most likely forgot to specify an essential library. For proper processing, all libraries that are referenced by your code must be specified, including the Java run-time library. For specifying libraries, use the -libraryjars option.
#For example, if ProGuard complains that it can't find a javax.crypto class, you probably still have to specify jce.jar, next to the more common rt.jar.
#If you're missing a library and you're absolutely sure it isn't used anyway, you can try your luck with the -ignorewarnings option, or even the -dontwarn option. Only use these options if you really know what you're doing though.
#For example, if you're developing for Android, and ProGuard complains that it can't find a java.awt class, then some library that you are using is referring to java.awt. This is a bit shady, since Android doesn't have this package at all, but if your application works anyway, you can let ProGuard accept it with "-dontwarn java.awt.**".

# Optimizations: If you don't want to optimize, use the
# proguard-android.txt configuration file instead of this one, which
# turns off the optimization flags.  Adding optimization introduces
# certain risks, since for example not all optimizations performed by
# ProGuard works on all versions of Dalvik.  The following flags turn
# off various optimizations known to have issues, but the list may not
# be complete or up to date. (The "arithmetic" optimization can be
# used if you are only targeting Android 2.0 or later.)  Make sure you
# test thoroughly if you go this route.
